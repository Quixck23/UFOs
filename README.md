# UFOs

UFO Sightings, are we alone?

## Overview of the Project
Dana's Article is to build an interactive table with data filled with UFO sightings in different areas in the US. Also, Dana would like to filter the data by multiple criteria, such as date, city, country and shape of the sight. We accomplish this by using JavaScript, HTML,CSS, taking advantage of the data stored in JavaScript language.

## Summary
We could improve by 
* looking for more data (International)
* Could add a heat map for better visualization
* Adding buttons for better user experience interaction
* We could add an interactive scatter plot to let the user see if there is any correlation depending on time zone, weather or area. 
* Box selection instead of typing for better U/X
